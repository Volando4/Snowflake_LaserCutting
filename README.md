# Snowflake_LaserCutting
In this repository will be presented whole procces of manufactoring a snoflake from reinginiring a model in a CAD program tp making it on a laser cutting machine.
## Inspiration
For this project I found a image of a 6-spike snowflake.

And I wanted to make it in a laser cutting machine.
## Making a model for laser cutting
After I put a image in CAD I made a copy of it, and made it 4 times smaller, to loose less material of plywood. Plywood is 3 millimeters thick.

I wanted to make it 3-way so I made this model.

We should save file in .cdr or .dxf extenction.
